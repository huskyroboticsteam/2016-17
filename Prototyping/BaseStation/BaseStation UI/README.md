## UI Dependencies

**MUST** inherit from:
[QWidget] (http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qwidget.html).

This allows for easy addition to the main UI framework.

### Extra features

Modular design should allow for a standalone runner file to operate each component of the UI outside of the framework.
If this is not possible, the dependency has not been properly written.
